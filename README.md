I have developed a game called Rebirth of Nuwa, which aims to explore the multiple identities of women and their emotional worlds in the modern family through virtual reality (VR) technology and the story of Nuwa, the god of creation in Chinese mythology. In this immersive experience, players will interact with elements in the virtual environment through gestural interactions to feel the strength and growth of women in the family.

In this VR experience, players will take on the role of Nuwa in three stages: creation, repair and rebirth. In the first stage, players gather resources through gestures and interactions, simulating the creation of nature and life. In the second stage, players will face broken skies and monsters, and repair broken family relationships and social structures by controlling the avatar, symbolising women's repairing role in the family. Finally, in the rebirth stage, through virtual interaction, players will be able to experience the process of Nuwa's metamorphosis, symbolising women's self-metamorphosis and growth.

Device used: Rokid glasses

The game was developed using the Unity engine to build interactive scenarios and gameplay mechanics that support immersive virtual reality experiences and gesture control, while Blender was used to create 3D models and environments to help design the virtual characters, objects, and scenarios in the game. Blender was used to create 3D models and environments to help design the virtual characters, objects, and scenes in the game, while the Rokid SDK was used to ensure compatibility of the game with the Rokid glasses and to enable gesture recognition and interaction.
